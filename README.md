## Project task
This is a redo of [this](https://github.com/dtomicic/advice-generator) project, that one was done with JS and HTML/CSS and I decided to try and redo it as my first solo React project.

## Project overview
Picked out this one for the similar reasons why I picked to do it without React in the first place, it's easy on the styling so no need to lose much time there also there is some work with an API which is interesting to me. Struggled a bit with my React code and still think it's not perfect and could be improved but for my first solo React project (not following any tutorials/code alongs or such) I think it turned out pretty good.
